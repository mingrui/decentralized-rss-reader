# decentralized-rss-reader
Decentralized *(TM)  rss reader built with petrolette and blockstack

## Goals
1. Use Petrolette front end: https://framagit.org/yphil/petrolette

this is an amazing app! One very cool feature is that there is a config file with all your rss subscriptions and app settings that you can export.

2. Use Blockstack for backend: https://blockstack.org/

Currently Blockstack provides default 5mb file storage, this size if perfect for Petrolette's config file.

3. Use Blockstack's "Multiplayer storage" feature so multiple people can access the same config file.

4. Make a tutorial for people to very easily setup with DAPP *(TM)
